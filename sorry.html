            <h2>Let me just start by saying I'm so sorry Bubba.</h2>
            <p>I know I've hurt you and I'm already regretting so many things. I regret saying bhar me jara hu and sleeping. I know you said it in anger and you didn't mean it. It was my job to make sure things were alright and cheer you up instead of sleeping ghusse me. Mera bacha I'm so sorry for sleeping instead of realizing you've cut the call. If I knew, I would have called you back and if you didn't pick, I'd spam you messages atleast do something. Felt really shitty when I woke up and realized that you hadn't slept for a minute and I was asleep thinking you're sleeping with me. Wese it was stupid of me tbh, I already should have known you wouldn't sleep after I upset you. It's a given at this point and shame on me for not having realized that us waqt.</p>
            <p>I want to apologize hath jor ke and say this. I am very, deeply, shamefully, sadly, idiotically sorry. I know I keep pissing you off all the time. I'm sorry for every tear I have brought to your eye. I really am. I wish I was able to go back in time and fix it then and there. I don't even know why I'm here making this big gesture instead of calling you and making things better asap.</p>
            <p>The thing is, I have made so many bhunds by now. I hate making stupid idiotic mistakes. I try so hard to control both my anger and my behaviour and to be fair, I do keep myself in check alot. But since I can't control the outcome, I resort to avoiding it. Isliye I sleep. It's the same shit as gaming. It's me avoiding the problem and I would like to stop. Is hi liye I'm making this entry on the site so that it's etched in history. I want to officially start working on bettering this flaw of mine. And I want to ask you for your help. Would you please help fix me? I promise I'll do what you need me to do and will make you proud in the end :D What say you?</p>
            <p>And before you say anything, I know me making this isn't enough for maafi. Isliye all I am asking for is for you to come and talk to me. Let's figure it all out. I'll do everything that I have to in order to make my baby happy again. I promise! Come back to me bubbu :(</p>

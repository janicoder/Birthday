            <p>So I know, you would do anything in the world to be able to spend even one more second with Appi. From everything I've heard about her, she was the perfect sister. She meant everything to you and still does. Nobody can and will ever replace her. Surely, she is in Heaven. Looking over you, wishing you a Happy Birthday! She must be wishing every joy in the world onto you. If she was here she would be singing this song with you. What else would she do?</p>

            <hr style="width:30%;margin: 30px 0px;">
            <h3>The first thing she would do</h3>
            <p><em><strong>*Huge Hug with tons of kisses*</strong></em></p>
            <p>She would be stunned at how beautiful you are. I mean she always knew you were pretty beautiful even as a child but she would see you and compliment every single thing. She would notice how your teeth are straighter than a ruler and be like when did you get braces???</p>
            <p>And then she would look at your height and say meri Hibu mujhse lambi kyu hogai!!! But damn Masha Allah, you're so tall now! And so beautiful. You're in a law school now? That must be so hard. I heard law is very tough and lengthy.</p>
            <p>Then you would tell her that you got a distinction with bare minimum parhai :) And then she would instantly order you a cake! I know that for a fact. She would hug you and start crying because appi was very emotional na :( and plus she loves you so much so rona tou aa hi jata</p>
            <p>Then you guys would catch up for hours and hours. You'd tell her about everything. About Bhabhi, Ayzel and even Me. My hands would be shaking like when they were when I dropped gifts at your house and Mama called me and said andar tou ajatay :)</p>
            <p>Then she would tell you what Heaven is like. She'd tell you she has everything she could dream of and that shes very happy there. She would thank you for all the gifts you send in the form of prayers. She would tell you how after every few minutes, an angel comes and announces Hiba Babar sent one billion tons of prayers for Yumna Babar Mirza. And how every other person there is constantly in shock ke damn man these two are so lucky to have each other. Even when seperated with life and death, these two are still sending tons of prayers to one another daily. I'm sure not a single day passes that she doesn't pray for you. Jitna ap unko miss karri utna hi wo bhi tou miss karrin hongin na :( I just hope I could make you two meet. That would have been so amazing. I would legit give my life if it allowed me to trade with Appi. I know that would be the ultimate gift to my gift and you would have all the joy in the world to have a second chance with her.</p>
            <p>Man this is so heart breaking. I know I'm trying to show you that she would be so happy if she    was here, and even by not being here, she still must be singing happy birthday every time you grow a year older. Everytime you do something amazing, she must be filled with so much joy yar. But I've been crying while typing this. It's so sad to think about yar. I know you always miss her on your birthdays and I thought about not writing this part so ap unko yad karke sad na hojao. But then I thought there's no way that you won't think of her. So I should just give you this little gift. I know you know all these things but I just thought it might be nice to read it and think about how happy and proud Appi must be of you. And I remember you told me the day we talked about appi on snapchat, in 11. The first time you shared something personal with me, you told me that you and Appi shared this song. I remembered that and I thought this is the perfect place to insert it. So just close your eyes for a moment. Think about her. Think about how happy she must be with all your accomplishments. Think of how she must be trying to cheer you up at your lowest points. How she would be telling you to hold on when the times get tough as there is an up after every down.</p>
            <p>On Appi's behalf, Happy Birthday Hibu! Her sexy wala bandar. May you have all the blessings and happiness in the world. May every passing day bring you incredible sums of joy. May your smile never fade. May you grow up to become the most successful lawyer. May you get married to the person that makes you the happiest (because she didn't get a chance to meet me warna this would be replaced with my name :) ). May you have adorable babies. May you make our (appi and your) parents proud. I hope you get to fulfill all your dreams. I hope that you know I'm looking over you from the gates of heaven and am always right by your side. Have an amazing Birthday Hibu</p>

            <p>With that, I'm ending this gift. I wish I was able to add alot more to this but your birthday is in a little under two hours and I have to pack these files and fix the bugs in the code. I promise to keep adding to this gift. I will make this present 10 times better as i learn to code more and improve my skills. But for now, this is all I have learnt and I'm sorry that it's so small right now but I swear if I knew how much work this would take, I would have started coding 10 years ago so that this birthday of yours would have been 10 x more special</p>
            <p>Happiest Birthday to my love!</p>
            <p>-Your's forever</p>
            <p>Bubba</p>

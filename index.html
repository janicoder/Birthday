            <h2>You may be wondering... "What is this!?"</h2>
            <p>As you know, I have been wanting to put all my effort into a gift that you will remember for a lifetime. At first I thought, it's very simple. Just get her a jewelry set to go along with her ring! But then I realized i'd be doing the exact thing that you don't like. Putting money into a gift and not effort. So I got to thinking, what is something that I can do that would take alot of effort and would be something nobody else has ever given you?</p>
            <p>The answer was infront of me all along. I have been learning to code and the timing could not be better! I know I gave you a letter type book made in MS word but here... I can unleash my creativity and add in so many things that I couldn't do in word! So here we are. Get ready for the wish of a lifetime! That's not all though, you will find a bunch of other things here as well :D</p>
            
            <div class="memories">
                <hr style="width:100%;margin: 30px 0px;">
                <h4>Here's a Beautiful memory</h4>
                <p style="margin: 40px"><img id="memory" src="./rss/aikHiTouHai.jpg" style="height: 400px"></p>
            </div>

            <hr style="width:30%;margin: 30px 0px;">
            <h2>Why a website and not a text?</h2>
            <p>The answer is pretty simple. I have so much love in my heart. I want to express it. I have had trouble expressing it for so long. I've become dull. I've become a shadow of what I used to be. So this is going to help me show you 1% of the love that I have for you. I'll be able to express what I feel. Here I am able to play the songs that make me feel things. The cute ones. The sad ones. The special ones. I'm able to play them on que whenever I want so that you have the best experience! Not only that but I'm able to show my creativity here. I know Warisha and Zainab have made you gifts that I can never match. So I thought why make something that will be shadowed by the countless amazing gifts that your amazing friends have given over the years. So I decided, I will use the skills that I have to make you something that you have never recieved! This is why I'm so confident that you'll love this gift. This is the ultimate personalized gift combined with months of effort. I know I love to buy you expensive gifts but after spending so much time and putting so much effort in this gift, I see the appeal. I see why you always say that you would rather get something that's made with thought behind it even if there was not a single rupee spent behind it. The attachment that I have developed to this gift is amazing. I'm actually surprised at how much I love this so I can only imagine how you will feel. And even if you don't like the idea, I'm sure you'll love the wish and the memories that I have put here :D</p>

            <h2>You may be wondering... "What is this!?"</h2>
            <p>As you know, I have been wanting to put all my effort into a gift that you will remember for a lifetime. At first I thought, it's very simple. Just get her a jewelry set to go along with her ring! But then I realized i'd be doing the exact thing that you don't like. Putting money into a gift and not effort. So I got to thinking, what is something that I can do that would take alot of effort and would be something nobody else has ever given you?</p>
            <p>The answer was infront of me all along. I have been learning to code and the timing could not be better! I know I gave you a letter type book made in MS word but here... I can unleash my creativity and add in so many things that I couldn't do in word! So here we are. Get ready for the wish of a lifetime! That's not all though, you will find a bunch of other things here as well :D</p>
            <h2>What should you expect from this gift??</h2>
            <p>Well this is what I have so far:
                <ul>
                    <li>A Wish</li>
                    <li>Photos</li>
                    <li>Videos</li>
                    <li>Songs</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
